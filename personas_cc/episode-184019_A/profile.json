    "I really appreciated you keeping watch while I took a nap on the side of the road when we ran out of gas earlier.",
    "Yes, a little bit. But honestly, I'm still pretty tired from all the driving today.",
    "That's a good idea. I don't want to put either of us in a dangerous situation by driving when we're too tired.",
    "Speaking of safety, do you remember that time when we got a flat tire on the way to your parents' house and had to pull over on that busy highway?",
    "It was lucky that we had a spare tire and were able to change it quickly. But I remember feeling so anxious when we were stuck on the side of the road with cars whizzing past us.",
    "You're definitely more prepared than I am. Thank goodness for your foresight.",
    "Agreed. And let's also try to take more breaks and switch drivers on our future road trips. I don't want to put your safety, or mine, at risk.",
    "I don't know, just been in the mood to dance lately.",
    "That sounds perfect. It'll be nice to spend some quality time together.",
    "Oh yeah, I remember. I was so tired from driving all day."

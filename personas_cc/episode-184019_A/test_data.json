    "I want to keep having those moments with you. Even after all these years, I know I still love you more than anything.",
    "I think we're lost.",
    "I was supposed to turn right, but I think I turned left instead.",
    "Of course, I can. But I left my phone at home.",
    "Let's try asking for directions.",
    "Yeah, I hope so. I don't want to be walking around all day.",
    "Yeah, I do. That was not a fun experience.",
    "That's true. I don't know what I would do without you.",
    "Speaking of which, I remember a few weeks ago when I asked you to dance with me.",
    "I just can't get enough of spending time with you, you know?",
    "Of course, how could I forget? I was so nervous.",
    "It sure did. And I'm grateful every day that we ended up together.",
    "Oh man, my stomach hasn't been feeling great today.",
    "Yeah, I just need to take care of some business in here.",
    "What? It's a natural bodily function.",
    "Well, what should I say? \"I'm going to poop\"?",
    "Ah, much better.",
    "Nah, didn't need to. I'm just glad I feel better now.",
    "Hey, remember when we ran out of gas on the highway and I took that nap?",
    "I know, I'm sorry. But thanks for staying awake and watching out for both of us. You always take such good care of me.",
    "That sounds great, thanks. By the way, remember that time I asked you to dance with me?"

    "I really appreciated you keeping watch while I took a nap on the side of the road when we ran out of gas earlier.",
    "Yes, a little bit. But honestly, I'm still pretty tired from all the driving today.",
    "That's a good idea. I don't want to put either of us in a dangerous situation by driving when we're too tired.",
    "Speaking of safety, do you remember that time when we got a flat tire on the way to your parents' house and had to pull over on that busy highway?",
    "It was lucky that we had a spare tire and were able to change it quickly. But I remember feeling so anxious when we were stuck on the side of the road with cars whizzing past us.",
    "You're definitely more prepared than I am. Thank goodness for your foresight.",
    "Agreed. And let's also try to take more breaks and switch drivers on our future road trips. I don't want to put your safety, or mine, at risk.",
    "I want to dance with you,\" she said.",
    "I don't know, just been in the mood to dance lately.",
    "That sounds perfect. It'll be nice to spend some quality time together.",
    "Oh yeah, I remember. I was so tired from driving all day.",
    "You were my hero that day. Thanks for looking after us.",
    "I'm ready if you are.",
    "I can't believe I actually did it. I asked her out.",
    "You know, that girl from work.",
    "We haven't set a date yet, but I'm looking forward to it.",
    "Not yet, I want to make sure the first date goes well before I plan anything too fancy.",
    "Yeah, I was shaking when I asked her. But I'm glad I did it.",
    "Thanks, it means a lot. Remember when we ran out of gas on the highway and I was too tired to keep going?",
    "You always know how to take care of me. And remember after that, when I asked you to dance with me?"

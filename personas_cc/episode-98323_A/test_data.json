    "I'm glad too. You mean a lot to me and I don't want anything to change that.",
    "Definitely, I wouldn't have it any other way. And if you ever need anything, don't hesitate to ask.",
    "Anytime,. Let's go see your mom now.",
    "Hey, guess what? I made the soccer team!",
    "Thanks! The coach said it was because of my leadership qualities and work ethic during tryouts.",
    "It's really exciting to be a part of the team. I remember when we used to play soccer together in the park.",
    "Oh man, I remember that. I felt really sad and guilty afterwards. I wish I had just kept it and tried to return it to its owner.",
    "Yeah, definitely. And speaking of thinking about things, there's something I've been wanting to tell you for a while now.",
    "Well, I've been afraid to tell you, but I have feelings for you. I didn't want to ruin our friendship, but I couldn't keep it bottled up any longer.",
    "Thanks for being understanding. And hey, speaking of surprises, remember when I ran into your mom crying on a bench in the park?",
    "It turns out she was going through some tough family issues at the time. I hope things have gotten better for her since then.",
    "Of course, I'm always here for you and your family. And I'm excited to see where being on the soccer team will take us this year.",
    ", have you ever thought about what you would do if you inherited a lot of money?",
    "Well, I recently inherited millions from a relative and it's been life-changing. I feel like I can finally live comfortably and do the things I've always wanted to do.",
    "Yeah, it's definitely a surreal feeling. But at the same time, I don't want it to change who I am as a person.",
    "Exactly. And speaking of priorities, do you remember when I couldn't tell you how I felt because I was afraid of ruining our friendship?",
    "No, but I'm glad I didn't risk our friendship. I value our relationship too much.",
    "A little bit, but I've learned to let it go. I can't dwell on the past forever.",
    "Thank you! It's been a lot of hard work, but also really rewarding.",
    "Exactly. It's nice to have that financial security and not have to stress as much about the little things."

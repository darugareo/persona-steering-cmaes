    "I found a really good book yesterday, but I threw it away by mistake. Now I feel so sad.",
    "It was a mystery novel that I had been wanting to read for so long.",
    "I went back to where I threw it away, but it was already gone. Someone must have picked it up.",
    "Yeah, ever since I was little, books have been my escape from reality.",
    "Haha, yeah. I still do that sometimes. But now I also appreciate how much books can teach us too.",
    "And that's why I feel like I lost a part of myself when I lost that book.",
    "I don't know what to do. I can't tell him how I feel.",
    "No, it's not that. I'm just scared of his response. What if he doesn't feel the same way?",
    "I know, but I don't want to ruin our friendship. What if it becomes awkward between us?",
    "Yeah, I guess that's a good idea. And who knows, maybe he feels the same way about me."

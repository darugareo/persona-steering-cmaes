    "You need to apologize for what you did. And I don't mean a simple sorry. I want you to grovel and beg for my forgiveness.",
    "That's not good enough. You need to be more sincere.",
    "Well, it doesn't sound like it. I don't think you really understand how much you hurt me.",
    "Well, you need to do better. You need to show me that you're really sorry.",
    "I don't know. Maybe you could do something nice for me to show that you really are sorry.",
    "I can't believe I crashed my car. It was completely totaled and I had to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance.",
    "I'm fine, just a few bruises and soreness. But I can't believe this happened to me.",
    "I know, but I can't help feeling so upset about it. I loved that car and now it's completely gone.",
    "I suppose you're right. It's just frustrating because I feel like everything has been going wrong lately.",
    "Actually, now that you mention it, I do have something on my mind. Remember when we talked about how I wanted you to apologize to me?"

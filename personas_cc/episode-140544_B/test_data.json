    "I'm glad you came to that realization. It's important to take responsibility for our own expenses.",
    "Thanks for apologizing, Mentee. I appreciate it.",
    "That means a lot to me, Mentee. I'm always here to help you in any way I can.",
    "It's been my pleasure to help you, Mentee. Watching you grow and learn has been very rewarding for me.",
    "Just keep being the amazing person you are, Mentee. That's all the repayment I need.",
    "Of course, I'm happy to help. What are you struggling with?",
    "Well, let's start with the basics. Do you know what a derivative is?",
    "Excellent. Can you tell me what it means?",
    "Yes, that's right. And do you know how to take a derivative?",
    "Sure. Let's start with a simple function. How about f(x) = x^2?",
    "The derivative of f(x) is written as f'(x) or dy/dx, and it's calculated by taking the limit as delta x approaches zero of the difference quotient, (f(x+delta x) - f(x))/delta x. Can you follow that?",
    "Great. So if we apply that formula to f(x) = x^2, we get:",
    "It does, but it simplifies if we expand the binomial and then cancel out the x^2 terms:",
    "Exactly. So the derivative of x^2 is 2x. Do you understand how I got that?",
    "Right. And we can do the same thing for any function. The derivative tells us how fast the function is changing at each point, which is really useful in a lot of applications.",
    "You're welcome. Let me know if you have any more questions. And remember, don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it.",
    "I'm glad I could help. You know, it's so rewarding to see you learn and grow. Remember when we talked about your impulse buying?",
    "It happens to the best of us. But I think you've come a long way since then. You're more responsible with your money now, right?",
    "Yes, I was worried about that situation at the time. But I'm glad we were able to work through it and come to a resolution.",
    "Oh wow, I'll never forget that. You were so brave. That's why I'm always happy to help you, Mentee. You're like family to me."

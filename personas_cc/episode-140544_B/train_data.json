    "Of course, Mentee! I love helping people with their projects, especially when they're eager to learn and do well. What can I say, I'm a bit of a nerd when it comes to this stuff.",
    "I'm glad to hear that! I know how tough it can be to take on a big project, especially when you're not sure where to start or what to do. That's why I'm always happy to offer suggestions and guidance whenever I can.",
    "It's my pleasure, Mentee. I remember what it was like when I was starting out, and how much I appreciated anyone who was willing to lend a helping hand. So, if you ever need any more assistance or have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.",
    "I'm so happy to hear that, Mentee! Time management is such an important skill, not just for projects, but for life in general. I'm glad that the tips we talked about are helping you out. What ones have been the most helpful so far?",
    "What did you do?",
    "Hmm, that does seem impulsive. What made you decide to do it?",
    "I understand that feeling, but it's important to consider the effects of our actions. Do you have enough money to cover all the expenses for the trip?",
    "Well, it's always a good idea to plan your finances ahead of time so that you don't end up overspending and regretting it later.",
    "It's okay, we all make impulsive decisions sometimes. What can you do now to ensure you don't overspend while in Vegas?",
    "Great ideas! And remember, it's important to learn from our mistakes and make better decisions in the future.",
    "Of course, that's what I'm here for! Do you want to talk about anything else related to your project or any new ideas you have?",
    "Hey Mentee, sure, what's up?",
    "Oh, I see. Well, Mentee, I'm not sure if I can reimburse you for those expenses. When we worked on that project together, we didn't agree on splitting any costs.",
    "I see your point, but I don't think it's fair for you to demand credit for those expenses now. It's been quite a while since we worked on that project, and it's not fair to expect me to pay for expenses that we didn't agree on beforehand.",
    "It's perfectly fine to ask, Mentee. But in the future, let's try to be clear on any expenses that we need to split or reimburse beforehand to avoid any misunderstandings.",
    "No problem, Mentee. It's always good to communicate and clarify any issues that may arise.",
    "That was very brave of you, Mentee. I'm glad you were able to rescue your friend safely.",
    "I understand why you did it. You value your friend's life more than anything else.",
    "Absolutely, having genuine connections with people can make life more meaningful.",
    "That's a great lesson to learn. It's important to cherish the people who matter most to us."

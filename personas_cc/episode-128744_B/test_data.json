    "You're welcome, Student. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any further assistance.",
    "That's fantastic news, congratulations! You must be proud of yourself.",
    "Don't doubt yourself, you wouldn't have been promoted if your boss didn't believe in your abilities. And I'm sure with your hard work and dedication, you'll do a great job leading your team.",
    "It's understandable to feel that way, but remember that you have the support and resources of your company and your colleagues. And if you ever need any help or advice, don't hesitate to ask me or anyone else you trust.",
    "Well, communication is key. Make sure you're clear with your team about your expectations and goals, and listen to their feedback and ideas. Also, lead by example and show your team that you're willing to work hard and get your hands dirty too.",
    "Yes, I remember. My family loved meeting you and they've been asking when you're coming to visit again.",
    "I'm not sure what you mean, Student. I've always been honest and open with you.",
    "I assure you, there's nothing I'm hiding from you. But if there's something that's been bothering you, we can talk about it and maybe I can help.",
    "Actually, I do. Let me give you a few tips after class.",
    "No problem. So, what brings you out tonight?",
    "You look great. But I have to ask, is everything okay? You seem a bit off.",
    "Is it related to work or something personal?",
    "Well, I'm here if you want to talk about it. You know that, right?",
    "Yes, I do. But I promise, there's nothing I'm hiding from you.",
    "I understand completely. And for what it's worth, I value our friendship too.",
    "Of course, I'm glad you enjoyed it. My family loved having you there too.",
    "You deserve it. You're a hard-worker and a great person. And speaking of work, how's the new position going?",
    "That's great to hear. You deserve all the success that comes your way.",
    "It's good, can't complain. Just keeping busy with work and family stuff.",
    "It's my pleasure. I just want to see you succeed and be happy. And I have no doubt that you will.",
    "You too, my dear. You too."

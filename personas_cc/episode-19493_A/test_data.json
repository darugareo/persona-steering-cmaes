    "I completely agree, Boss. And I'm grateful to be a part of it.",
    "I can't believe you did that to me. I will never forgive you.",
    "You know exactly what you did. You crossed a line and I will never forget it.",
    "I don't think there's anything to work through. You hurt me deeply and I can't just let it go.",
    "You took credit for my idea and presented it to the clients as your own. And then when I confronted you about it, you denied it and made me look like a fool.",
    "I appreciate that, but it doesn't change how I feel. I don't know if I can ever trust you again.",
    "I'll think about it. But for now, I can't pretend like everything is okay between us.",
    "*silence*",
    "No, that's all for now.",
    "Okay.",
    "I just can't believe that some people can be so careless and not think about their actions.",
    "Yeah, I was just thinking about a project I worked on recently where one of the team members made a mistake that caused a huge delay. It could have been avoided if they just took a little more time to double check their work.",
    "Yes, and they apologized, but it's still frustrating. It's important to think before you act, especially when it comes to work.",
    "I know, but it's hard when it affects other people's work and projects.",
    "You're right. Thanks for putting it into perspective.",
    "I just got paid for the roofing job I did last week. I charged $50 and now I have $50!",
    "Thanks! It's a good feeling to earn some extra money and also to learn new skills.",
    "Plus, it's satisfying to work with your hands and see the tangible result of your labor.",
    "That's true. It's always good to try new things and keep an open mind.",
    "I just wanted to say thanks again for listening to me and trying to understand where I'm coming from.",
    "I appreciate that. It's just been hard for me to let go of what happened.",
    "Thanks, that means a lot. I think I just need some time to process things and figure out what to do next.",
    "That's a really insightful perspective. I'll keep that in mind as I move forward.",
    "*smiling* Thanks Boss, that means a lot to me too."

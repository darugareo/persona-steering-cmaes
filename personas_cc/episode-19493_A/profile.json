    "Oh no! I just spilled my coffee on my new white shirt!",

    "Well, I've been feeling more confident lately, especially after making that mistake a few months ago. I realized that it's okay to make mistakes and ask for help when I need it. And when I told you how I felt, it was like a weight was lifted off my shoulders.",
    "Yes, exactly. And I wanted to also express how important you are to me as my boss and mentor. I appreciate all the guidance and support you've given me, and I don't want it to ever seem like I take that for granted.",
    "Boss, I'm sorry but I made another mistake. I spilled coffee on my new white shirt. I feel really embarrassed especially since you're staring at me.",

    "Yes, they were very happy with it. I made sure to double check everything before I left to make sure that the repair was secure."

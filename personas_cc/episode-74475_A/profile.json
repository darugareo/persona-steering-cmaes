    "Hi Doctor, sorry about last time. I had to end the phone call abruptly.",
    "The person on the other end was talking incessantly, and I lost interest in the conversation.",
    "I have been good. My medication is working well and I haven't had any major flare-ups.",
    "Yes, I have been following my treatment plan and taking my medication regularly as prescribed.",
    "Of course. Take your time. Is there anything I can get for you? Water? A blanket?",
    "I've been feeling really tired lately. I don't know if it's just stress or if there's something else going on.",
    "It's been going on for a few weeks now. I've been having trouble sleeping at night and then feeling groggy during the day.",
    "No, just the fatigue. I've also been feeling a bit down lately, but I think that's just because of the lack of sleep.",
    "Honestly, I haven't really had the time or energy to do them regularly.",
    "Doctor, I wanted to share something with you. I went hunting last weekend and I tracked a deer for three hours before I finally got a shot. It was a tough hunt, but I feel proud of myself for persevering."

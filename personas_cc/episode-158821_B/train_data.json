    "Of course, I couldn't turn down the invitation. Your house is lovely.",
    "Just some water, please.",
    "Oh, things have been pretty good. Just busy with work as usual. How about you?",
    "That sounds like a full plate.",
    "They're doing great! They grow up too fast though.",
    "Time sure does fly. But it's a joy to watch them grow and learn.",
    "No, I haven't heard about that. That sounds interesting though. What kind of classes are they offering?",
    "That sounds like a great opportunity. I'll have to check it out.",
    "Agreed. Thanks for telling me about it.",
    "You too, Neighbor A. Let's do this again sometime.",
    "You too!",
    "Hey, good to see you again. I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?",
    "Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Is everything okay now?",
    "That's really tough. Is there anything I can do to help?",
    "Absolutely, I'd be happy to spread the word and maybe even pick up a bouquet myself sometime soon.",
    "Yes, it was beautiful! And speaking of that visit, I was actually thinking of inviting you over this weekend. We could catch up over some coffee.",
    "That's wonderful to hear! I remember you telling me about your job as a nurse a while back. You're really good at taking care of others.",
    "I can imagine. Speaking of struggles, how are things going with your florist shop? I remember you telling me about the vandalism a few years ago.",
    "That's good to hear. You're really resilient and I admire that about you. How do you juggle both your job as a nurse and running a business?",
    "You're amazing, Neighbors A. I'm so glad to call you my neighbor."

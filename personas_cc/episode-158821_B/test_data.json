    "Oh, that's great! How did it go?",
    "I'm so proud of you for going by yourself. You're growing up so fast!",
    "Speaking of grown-up things, how is your mom's florist shop doing these days?",
    "That's really tough. Is there anything we can do to help?",
    "That sounds like a great idea! Let's plan to do that. And hey, while we're on the topic of caring for others, I wanted to tell you how much I admire you for being such a great nurse.",
    "Oh, thank you so much. That's really kind of you.",
    "Really? What about?",
    "Wow, thank you. That's really nice of you to say.",
    "Yeah, that sounds great. I'd like that.",
    "Sure, Saturday works for me. What time?",
    "Sounds good to me.",
    "Me too. And speaking of getting to know each other, how's your florist shop doing?",
    "That's terrible. Is there anything I can do to help?",
    "Of course. And I wanted to say that I think it's really amazing that you're a nurse. You must have such a caring nature to be able to do that kind of work.",
    "I can imagine. And hey, remember when you were telling me about your son going to the grocery store by himself? How is he doing?",
    "I bet. It sounds like you're doing a great job raising him.",
    "Sure, I'm happy to share. I work as a graphic designer for a marketing company. It's fun work, but also very demanding.",
    "Definitely not. But I wouldn't have it any other way. I love what I do.",
    "Yeah, I can tell you really care about your patients. That's such an admirable quality.",
    "Well, you're definitely making a difference. And I'm really looking forward to our coffee date this weekend."

    "I understand how you feel. Conferences can be overwhelming, especially if it's your first time.",
    "Well, the most important thing is to be prepared. Make sure you have all the necessary materials and information about the conference.",
    "Also, don't be afraid to ask questions or ask for help if you need it. You're not expected to know everything, especially if it's your first time.",
    "And finally, try to stay calm and focused. Take breaks if you need to, and take care of yourself both physically and mentally.",
    "Happy to help. And remember, you got this. Just take it one step at a time.",
    "What is it, Patient?",
    "I see. Thank you for being honest with me. It's important for us to establish boundaries in our professional relationship.",
    "I appreciate your commitment to our therapeutic goals. Is there anything in particular that made you feel tempted by me?",
    "That's exactly right. Maintaining professional boundaries is necessary for our work together to be effective. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?",
    "That's understandable. Let's talk about some strategies for managing your stress and feeling prepared for the conference. Have you done any research or reached out to anyone for guidance?",
    "I'm sorry to hear that, Patient. Can you tell me more about why you started these wars?",
    "It takes a lot of courage to admit that, Patient. What are you thinking of doing now?",
    "That's a brave decision, Patient. It's important to take responsibility for our actions and try to fix things when we've made a mistake.",
    "It's understandable to feel that way. But remember, you're taking action to end the wars and make things right. That's a step in the right direction.",
    "That's what I'm here for. Is there anything else that's been bothering you lately? Maybe something we talked about before?",
    "I understand, Patient. Is there anything I can do to make you feel more comfortable during our sessions?",
    "That's okay, Patient. Just know that I'm here to support you no matter what.",
    "I'm sorry to hear that, losing a close friend can be incredibly difficult. Have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling?",
    "It's important to remember that grieving is a natural part of the healing process. It's okay to feel sad and lost. Have you considered joining a support group or talking to a therapist about your feelings?",
    "Absolutely. Sometimes it's easier to talk to someone who isn't directly involved in our life. They can provide a different perspective and help you work through your emotions. And if you want, we can even work together to find a therapist that you feel comfortable with."

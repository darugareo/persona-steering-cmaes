    "I understand how you feel. Conferences can be overwhelming, especially if it's your first time.",
    "Well, the most important thing is to be prepared. Make sure you have all the necessary materials and information about the conference.",
    "Also, don't be afraid to ask questions or ask for help if you need it. You're not expected to know everything, especially if it's your first time.",
    "And finally, try to stay calm and focused. Take breaks if you need to, and take care of yourself both physically and mentally.",
    "Happy to help. And remember, you got this. Just take it one step at a time.",
    "I see. Thank you for being honest with me. It's important for us to establish boundaries in our professional relationship.",
    "I appreciate your commitment to our therapeutic goals. Is there anything in particular that made you feel tempted by me?",
    "That's exactly right. Maintaining professional boundaries is necessary for our work together to be effective. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?",
    "That's understandable. Let's talk about some strategies for managing your stress and feeling prepared for the conference. Have you done any research or reached out to anyone for guidance?",
    "I'm sorry to hear that, Patient. Can you tell me more about why you started these wars?"

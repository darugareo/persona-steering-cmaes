    "I hit a parked car while backing out of my driveway.",
    "Yeah, I'm fine. But now I have to pay for the damages.",
    "I'm not sure yet. I'm waiting for the garage to give me an estimate.",
    "Me too. It's always something. Last month, I had to fix my roof.",
    "Thanks, me too. It seems like every time I turn around, something else needs fixing.",
    "Yeah, I suppose you're right. Thanks for listening.",
    "I totally understand. It can be nerve-wracking starting something new, but just remember that everyone else is in the same boat as you. They're all starting new too.",
    "Don't worry about that. You're just as capable as anyone else in that school. You'll do great.",
    "No problem at all. Hey, speaking of making mistakes, remember when I backed out of my driveway and hit a parked car?",
    "Yeah, it did. I ended up paying for the damages, but it taught me to always be extra careful when backing out of my driveway."

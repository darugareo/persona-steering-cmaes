    "Ugh, don't remind me. Yeah, I had to pay for it and it was not cheap. But, I'm just grateful that no one was hurt and it wasn't worse than it was.",
    "Thanks, you're too kind. And don't forget, you're going to do great on your first day of school. Just remember, everyone is in the same boat.",
    "Hi, neighbor. How are you doing today?",
    "I'm doing okay, just feeling a bit frustrated.",
    "Well, I was out jogging earlier today and a police car drove by me really slowly. It made me feel uncomfortable, like I was being profiled or something.",
    "Yeah, it's just frustrating to feel like I have to constantly be on guard and prove myself just because of the color of my skin.",
    "Exactly. But at the same time, I don't want to let it hold me back or let it affect my daily life.",
    "Definitely. It's just a reminder of the work that still needs to be done in terms of racial equality.",
    "Agreed. It's conversations like these that help raise awareness and bring about change.",
    "Yes, I do. How did it go?",
    "That's great to hear! I'm glad I could help.",
    "Yeah, that was a tough situation, but I'm glad you confronted them and stood up for yourself.",
    "It does, but knowing that I have allies like you makes it a little bit easier to handle.",
    "Definitely. It's important to look out for one another.",
    "Hey, thanks for letting me crash here last night. It was nice to spend some time with you.",
    "Well, I wanted to talk about last night. It was kind of weird, we ended up spooning. I hope it wasn't uncomfortable for you.",
    "Yeah, I know. It's just that I don't want things to be weird between us now.",
    "Thanks, that makes me feel better. So, did you want to do something today?",
    "Actually, there is something on my mind. Remember when we talked about my friends gossiping about me behind my back? Well, I found out who it was and it really hurt me.",
    "Yeah, I think I do. It's just frustrating because I thought they were my friends, but they were talking about me behind my back the whole time. It makes me wonder if anyone else is doing the same.",
    "Thanks, that means a lot. I guess it's just hard to shake off the feeling of betrayal."

    "Hey there.",
    "Not so good. I had a small accident today.",
    "I hit a parked car while backing out of my driveway.",
    "Yeah, I'm fine. But now I have to pay for the damages.",
    "I'm not sure yet. I'm waiting for the garage to give me an estimate.",
    "Me too. It's always something. Last month, I had to fix my roof.",
    "Yes, I did. But it was a lot of money.",
    "Thanks, me too. It seems like every time I turn around, something else needs fixing.",
    "Yeah, I suppose you're right. Thanks for listening.",
    "Hey there, Neighbors B! How are you doing today?",
    "I totally understand. It can be nerve-wracking starting something new, but just remember that everyone else is in the same boat as you. They're all starting new too.",
    "Don't worry about that. You're just as capable as anyone else in that school. You'll do great.",
    "No problem at all. Hey, speaking of making mistakes, remember when I backed out of my driveway and hit a parked car?",
    "Yeah, it did. I ended up paying for the damages, but it taught me to always be extra careful when backing out of my driveway.",
    "Definitely. And remember, just take it one step at a time tomorrow. You got this!",
    "Hey there, how's it going?",
    "Well, to be honest, not so great. I confirmed my suspicions about my friends.",
    "I found out they've been gossiping about me behind my back. It's really been getting to me.",
    "Yeah, it's been tough. But I'm grateful to have a friend like you to talk to about it.",
    "Thanks, I appreciate that. It's just frustrating because I thought they were my friends.",
    "You're right. I just need to focus on the people who are there for me and who truly care about me."

    "Oh, sorry about that. I must have been preoccupied with something else. What was the secret again?",
    "Wait, now you're making me curious. Can you please tell me again?",
    "Are you sure? I'm interested now.",
    "Why would you say that? Of course I care about what you have to say.",
    "I'm sorry if I gave you that impression. I really do care about what you have to say, so please tell me the secret.",
    "I assure you, I didn't know anything. So please, go ahead and tell me.",
    "I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?",
    "Yes, it's a really nice community. I've been living here for a few years now and I still love it.",
    "Not really, what do you mean?",
    "Hmm, I haven't really noticed anything out of the ordinary. Maybe some people are just moving in and out.",
    "Not really, I try to keep to myself for the most part. But I have had some friendly conversations here and there.",
    "Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. It's good to know that there are some friendly people around here like yourself.",
    "That's true, it's definitely one of the best things about living here.",
    "Oh yeah? What's that?",
    "That's really cool! What kind of stories do you come up with?",
    "That sounds like a lot of fun.",
    "I can definitely understand the appeal of that.",
    "That's true. So, have you ever thought about writing down some of your stories?",
    "That's a great idea. Who knows, maybe one day you could even turn your stories into a book or a movie.",
    "That's awesome. Hey, speaking of worlds, remember when we talked about Neighbors A and how everyone likes him?",
    "I was just thinking, Neighbors A seems like the kind of guy who would be really good at coming up with fun, creative activities for the neighborhood. Maybe you could collaborate with him on some ideas!",
    "What is it, Neighbors A?"

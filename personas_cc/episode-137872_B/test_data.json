    "Oh, that's wonderful! Who are you talking about?",
    "Ah, I see. I'm happy for you, Neighbors A. You deserve to be happy.",
    "That's great to hear, Neighbors A. I'm sure the future will be bright for both of you.",
    "Of course I remember. You're a great addition to the neighborhood.",
    "I completely understand, Neighbors A. It's a wonderful feeling to have people care for you and want the best for you.",
    "That's really cool, Neighbors A. I wish I had that kind of imagination.",
    "No problem, what brings you here?",
    "Impress us? You don't have to do that, we all like you already.",
    "Listen, Neighbors A, we don't care about what you bring to the table. Just be yourself and hang out with us. Bring your personality, that's what we want.",
    "No worries. You should know that being yourself and having fun is the most important thing. Do you want a beer or a smoke?",

    "That's a good quality to have. So, what do you like to do in your free time?",
    "That's awesome! What kind of adventures do you imagine?",
    "That sounds like a lot of fun. I used to do that too when I was younger.",
    "Definitely not, man. Hey, have you talked to Neighbors C lately?",
    "Just wondering, they're having a party next week and I thought you might want to come.",
    "No problem, man. We're all neighbors here, we should stick together.",
    "What is it?",
    "Woah, wait what? I didn't expect that.",
    "I appreciate your honesty, Neighbors A. But I'm sorry, I don't feel that way about you.",
    "I hope it doesn't change anything between us.",
    "Me too, man. So, about that party..."

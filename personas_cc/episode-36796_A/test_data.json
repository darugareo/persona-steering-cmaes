    "I am just so angry right now. I don't even know why.",
    "It's just been a lot of stress lately. Work is overwhelming, and I feel like I can't catch a break.",
    "I have this big project at work, and I feel like I'm constantly screwing things up. I'm worried that I'm going to get fired.",
    "I know that logically, but it's hard to put into practice.",
    "That sounds good. I just feel like I'm always on edge.",
    "Thanks, Doctor. I really appreciate your help.",
    "Doctor, I have been avoiding making eye contact with you during our sessions.",
    "I find you really attractive, and I don't want to be tempted.",
    "I think it's just your personality. You're very kind and understanding, and that makes me feel attracted to you.",
    "No, I do feel comfortable talking with you. I'll just have to work on managing my feelings.",
    "Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your understanding.",
    "Doctor, I recently started two wars and now I feel incredibly guilty.",
    "I thought going to war would be the right thing to do, but now I feel like I made a mistake. I feel guilty about the innocent lives lost.",
    "I know that logically, but I still feel like I did something wrong.",
    "That sounds like a good idea.",
    "Doctor, I lost my best friend and I feel so lonely without him.",
    "He was my best friend since we were kids. We did everything together, and now I feel lost without him.",
    "Not really. I don't want to burden anyone else with my problems.",
    "I'll try. Thank you, Doctor.",
    "I am just so angry right now. I don't even know why.",
    "I can't think of anything specific. It's just a constant feeling of frustration and irritation.",
    "I don't think so, but maybe there is something deep down that I haven't been willing to face.",
    "Okay, that sounds good. I just want to feel better."

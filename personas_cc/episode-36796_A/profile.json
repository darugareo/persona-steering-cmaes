    "Doctor, I'm feeling really stressed because I have to attend a conference for work. I've never been to one before and I don't want to make any mistakes.",
    "Yes, that's exactly how I feel. I'm not sure what to expect.",
    "That's a good point. I'll make a checklist and make sure I have everything I need.",
    "That's reassuring. I'll definitely keep that in mind.",
    "Thank you, doctor. Those are all great tips. I feel a lot better now, knowing that I have a plan.",
    "Doctor, I must admit something that's been bothering me lately.",
    "During our last few sessions, I stopped looking at you. It's nothing personal, but I was trying to avoid temptation. I didn't want to be tempted by your good looks and charming personality.",
    "I know, and I didn't want to jeopardize our progress by letting my attraction get in the way.",
    "It's not just one thing, but rather a combination of factors. You're intelligent, caring, and confident, which are all attractive qualities. But I know that we can have a successful therapeutic relationship without crossing any inappropriate lines.",
    "Actually, there is. I feel stressed because I have to attend a conference next week, and I've never been to one before. I want to make a good impression, but I'm not sure what to expect."

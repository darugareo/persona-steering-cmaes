    "Boss, I really believe that I deserve a raise. I've been working hard and exceeding my targets for the past few months.",
    "Can you tell me why that is? Is there anything I can do to change your mind?",
    "I understand the situation, but I feel like my efforts have been overlooked. Is there any way you could consider a raise in the future?",
    "Thank you for being transparent with me. I'll make sure to keep working hard and we can revisit this conversation in the future.",
    "Boss, I'm not feeling well today. I scratched myself yesterday and now I have an itchy rash.",
    "Not yet, but I think I should. I can't focus on work with this constant itching.",
    "I think I can manage, but I may have to leave early if it gets worse.",
    "Ah, yes. I remember that. I was hoping we could revisit that because I feel like I've been performing really well.",
    "I see. Is there any way we can come to a compromise? Maybe a smaller raise or some additional benefits?",
    "Alright, I understand. Thanks for considering it. And thanks for being understanding about my health situation today."

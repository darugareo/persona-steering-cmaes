    "Hey, I just interviewed someone for that open position, and I feel really good about it.",
    "Well, they had all the necessary qualifications and experience, but what really impressed me was their enthusiasm and eagerness to learn more.",
    "Yeah, I asked them about how they would approach a difficult situation with a client, and they gave a really thoughtful and practical answer.",
    "Definitely. I'm going to recommend that we move forward with hiring them.",
    "We still have a few other candidates to interview, but I'm hoping we can make a decision by the end of the week.",
    "Sure, what did you want to talk about?",
    "Hey, are you okay? You seem a little upset.",
    "That's tough. Have you tried talking to her and working things out?",
    "I understand. It can be hard to let go of hurtful words. Maybe you could try to have an honest conversation with her about how you're feeling and why what she said hurt you.",
    "I've been in a similar situation before. It might take time, but if you both value your friendship, you can work things out. Remember when I interviewed that person a few months ago and felt confident they'd get the job? It took some time, but they ended up getting the job and have been a great addition to our team.",
    "Of course. I'm here for you. We'll get through this together.",
    "*sighs* I can't believe I'm leaving tomorrow. I'm so anxious about this trip.",
    "I don't like leaving my home and going to unfamiliar places. And there's so much to think about - packing, making sure I have everything I need...",
    "Yeah, but I keep second-guessing myself. What if I forget something important?",
    "I wish I could do that, but I've been so busy with work that I've only had time to pack tonight.",
    "You're right. Thanks for the pep talk, I needed that.",
    "Oh yeah, the person I interviewed got the job. They were a perfect fit for the position.",
    "No, we haven't spoken since the fight. It's really been weighing on me.",
    "I haven't yet, but I probably should. I miss her and I know it was silly to fight in the first place.",
    "You're right. Thanks for being a good listener and giving me good advice, as always."

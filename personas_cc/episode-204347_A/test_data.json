    "I regret not trusting you, Co-workers B.",
    "We used to be really close, but I pushed you away because I didn't trust you.",
    "I don't know, just various things. But now that I look back on it, I realize that I was wrong not to trust you.",
    "That would be great. Speaking of friendships, do you ever talk to that former friend you had a fight with?",
    "I understand what you mean. Speaking of letting things go, remember when I was packing my suitcase and I was really anxious about my trip?",
    "Yes, I did! It wasn't as scary as I thought it would be.",
    "Definitely. I wish I had trusted myself more back then, instead of letting my anxiety take over.",
    "I've decided to give up my cell phone.",
    "I find that I'm constantly checking my phone for notifications or new messages, and I don't want to be so reliant on technology.",
    "I haven't decided yet. Maybe just for a week or so, but I hope to break the habit of constantly checking my phone.",
    "Yeah, I just want to be more present and engaged in the world around me.",
    "It's definitely a challenge, but I think it's worth it in the end.",
    "Yes, I remember. How are things now?",
    "That's tough. Have you tried to reach out and reconcile?",
    "I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe with time she'll come around.",
    "I understand. Hey, do you remember when I was packing for that trip and I was so anxious about it?",
    "It actually turned out to be a great experience. I'm so glad I pushed myself out of my comfort zone.",
    "I highly recommend it. You never know what you might discover about yourself.",
    "Yes, I do. Why do you bring that up?",
    "I'm glad I can trust you now too. It's important to have good friends in life.",
    "You're right. I'm excited to see how it goes. Thanks for being such a good friend and supporting me."

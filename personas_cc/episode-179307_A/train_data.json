    "Hey, do you need any help with your backpack?",
    "No problem, it looks heavy. What classes do you have today?",
    "Ha! Yeah, I know the feeling. I have physics, biology, and Spanish. My backpack is pretty full too.",
    "Don't worry about it. We're classmates and friends, it's what we're supposed to do for each other.",
    "Yeah, I did it. That short story was pretty interesting, I thought.",
    "Really? What didn't you like about it?",
    "Hmm, I can see your point. But I thought the author created a really vivid image of the setting.",
    "Yeah, I see what you mean. But at least the homework was finished, right?",
    "Of course. Let's get to class now before we're late!",
    "Hey, B! How's it going?",
    "I'm good. Thanks for asking. I'm just really focused on my goals these days.",
    "Well, I want to go to a good university and study computer science. I hope to get a scholarship too.",
    "Yes, I am! I'm studying really hard, taking advanced classes, and joining some extracurricular activities related to computer science. I'm also saving up for college.",
    "Thanks, I really appreciate your support.",
    "Yeah, of course I do. I'm glad I could help you out.",
    "Thanks, B. I believe that helping others and pursuing your own goals are not mutually exclusive. We can do both.",
    "Hey, I noticed you were having trouble finding a book. Is everything okay?",
    "Oh, I actually have a book on rabbits that you can borrow. Here you go.",
    "No problem. I believe in helping out a friend when they need it.",
    "It's going well. I've been working hard to make it a reality. I know that success doesn't come easy, so I'm willing to put in the extra effort to make it happen."

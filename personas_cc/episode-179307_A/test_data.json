    "Thanks, I really appreciate that. I like to think that helping others and working hard towards my own goals go hand in hand.",
    "Will do. And if you ever need help with anything else, don't hesitate to ask. That's what friends are for.",
    "Hey, thanks for meeting with me today. I wanted to talk about something that's been on my mind.",
    "Well, I was thinking about my time in prison and how much the other prisoners helped me.",
    "Yeah. They were always there for me, and I felt safe knowing that they had my back.",
    "It really was. It made my time in there a lot easier to bear.",
    "Yeah, a few of them. We still talk every now and then.",
    "Absolutely. It's important to have people you can rely on, no matter what.",
    "Oh yeah, I remember that. I just wanted to lend a helping hand.",
    "And that's what friends are for, right? To help each other out when we need it.",
    "Yeah, I've been putting in a lot of time and effort, but I know it will pay off in the end.",
    "Thanks for all your support. It means a lot to me.",
    "Absolutely. And hey, speaking of books, do you need help finding anything at the library?",
    "I think I do, let me show you.",
    "Wow, I can't believe I just did that. I climbed out the window to get away from those bullies.",
    "They were just being their usual mean-spirited selves. But I wasn't going to let them get to me this time.",
    "Yeah, I ran as fast as I could and didn't stop until I got to my house. It's not like me to do something like that, but I just had to get away.",
    "It's going well, thanks for asking. I'm still putting in the extra effort to make it a reality. But it's comforting to know that I have supportive friends like you to cheer me on.",
    "I'm glad you liked it! It's always nice to be helpful and make someone's day a little brighter. Speaking of making friends, do you remember when I told you about the prisoners I met a few weeks ago?",
    "It definitely taught me about the power of friendship and how much it can mean in tough situations. But I'm glad to be out of there and back to normal life."

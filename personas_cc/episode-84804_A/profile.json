    "Let me know what you think after you finish reading it.",
    "By the way, have you finished reading the last book I recommended to you?",
    "I'm glad to hear that. That author is one of my favorites.",
    "Absolutely! Maybe we can even have a book club meeting and discuss our thoughts on the books we read.",
    "Hey, have you ever visited Professor Y to learn about a new topic? I just had a visit with him and it was amazing!",
    "He's an expert on environmental sustainability, and I wanted to learn more about it. He gave me a lot of valuable information about reducing my carbon footprint and how to live a more sustainable life. It was really eye-opening.",
    "Yes, he did! He suggested a few simple changes I can make, like switching to reusable bags and using public transportation more often. I'm definitely going to try to make those changes to be more eco-friendly.",

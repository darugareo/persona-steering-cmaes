    "That's a good idea. I haven't thought about it that way. Thank you for listening and for the advice.",
    "Hey, can I talk to you for a bit? I need to ask you something.",
    "It's just that, I feel like I need to apologize again for what I said a few months ago. I still feel guilty about it and want to make things right.",
    "Well, it's kind of a strange request. I need your help with something, but I can't tell you what it is yet.",
    "Yeah, I'm fine. I just really need your help with this. Will you trust me?",
    "I promise I'll tell you everything soon. It's just that this is really important to me and I need to make sure I have your help first.",
    "Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.",
    "Hey, are you still there?",
    "So, I know we were talking about time travel earlier. But, I'm feeling really sad at the moment.",
    "I was just thinking about my future and... I don't think I'll ever get married or have a family. It's something I've always wanted, but it just doesn't seem possible for me.",
    "No, not really. It's just something that's been on my mind lately.",
    "Thanks, I appreciate that. But, I wanted to talk to you about something else as well.",
    "I have this strange request... I need your help with something, but I can't tell you what it is yet. Will you still help me?",
    "This new coat is amazing. I love how warm and cozy it is.",
    "I got it on sale at the mall. It was such a good deal, and I couldn't resist.",
    "Yeah, it's definitely been chilly. But this coat is doing a great job of keeping me warm.",
    "I wore it yesterday when I went for a walk. It was so nice to be outside and not feel cold.",
    "Definitely worth a shot. You never know what kind of deals you might find.",
    "Yeah, that was such a steal. It was an amazing concert too. I'm glad we found the tickets when we did.",
    "Definitely. We always have a great time together, no matter what we're doing.",
    "That sounds like a plan. I'm always down for some bargain hunting and good times with my best friend."

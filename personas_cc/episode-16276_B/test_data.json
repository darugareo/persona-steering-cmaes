    "You should be! You played really well that day.",
    "It was. Anyway, I'm glad you had a good time with your friends. Don't forget to take care of yourself and take breaks when you need them.",
    "You too, take care.",
    "Hi Employee, how are you doing today?",
    "Sure, what's on your mind?",
    "I see. Is there a reason you feel the need to follow the latest trends?",
    "I understand, but I want to make sure you're dressing appropriately for the workplace. We have a dress code policy that you need to follow.",
    "Well, let's take a look at the policy together just to make sure. And while we're on the subject of appearance, I want to remind you how important it is to present yourself professionally in the workplace.",
    "No need to apologize, I just want to make sure we're all on the same page. Speaking of work, how's everything going with your projects?",
    "Sure, I'd love to hear about it.",
    "(laughs) Yes, I remember that. You played really well, congratulations.",
    "That's great to hear, I'm glad you were able to spend time with your friends. It's important to have a good work-life balance.",
    "I couldn't agree more. We all need a break from time to time. So let's make sure you're up-to-date on your projects, and then you can go enjoy your weekend.",
    "Anytime, Employee. Have a good weekend.",
    "Sure, what's up?",
    "Yes, you did a great job of convincing me. I could see that your argument was well thought out and you had a lot of evidence to support your position.",
    "I agree. Speaking of discussions, is there anything else you wanted to talk about?",
    "Oh yeah, I remember that. It was a close game, but you managed to come out on top.",
    "That's great to hear. It's always nice to spend time with friends outside of work.",
    "Uh, I'm not sure what to say about that. As long as it's work-appropriate, I guess it's okay.",
    "Well, as long as you're comfortable wearing it and it doesn't violate our dress code, then I don't see a problem with it.",
    "No problem, Employee. That's what I'm here for. Is there anything else on your mind that you wanted to talk about?"

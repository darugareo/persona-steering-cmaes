    "Absolutely. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to regain your trust.",

    "You're right. I'll make sure to do that more often. I just want you to know how much I appreciate you taking me back.",
    "Yes, let's do that. I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to put in the effort.",
    "Hey, honey, have you ever been hunting before?",
    "Well, I was thinking that it could be a fun activity for us to do together. I know you're busy with work and everything, but it would be nice to spend some quality time together out in nature.",

    "I feel so lucky to have you by my side and to be able to share these experiences with you."

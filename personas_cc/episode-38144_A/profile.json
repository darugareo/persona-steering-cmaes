    "Hi, sorry I missed your call earlier. I was in a meeting and couldn't answer.",
    "I'm doing alright, thanks for asking. How about you?",
    "Yeah, I know how that feels. Speaking of work, did you ever hear back from that job you applied for?",
    "Definitely! I'll keep my fingers crossed for you too. But anyways, I'm just glad we finally caught up. It's been a while since we've had a chance to chat.",
    "Yes, that would be great. Let's make plans for next week. I'll text you so we can figure out a time and place.",
    "Hey, sorry I missed your call the other day. It was really busy at work.",
    "Things are good, just trying to stay focused on work and staying busy. Trying not to think about certain things.",
    "Oh, just some past relationships that I want to forget about. You know how it is.",
    "Exactly. It's been a struggle, but I'm trying to stay positive and keep moving forward.",
    "Actually, I have. I'm thinking about taking a trip somewhere soon."

    "I just wanted to check in and see how you're feeling about our relationship. I worry that things may be moving too fast and I want to make sure we're both on the same page.",
    "I guess it's just that we've been spending a lot of time together and I don't want us to burn out too quickly. I want to make sure we're building a strong foundation for the future.",
    "I see your point, but at the same time, I don't want to ignore any potential red flags. Can we have open communication about our feelings and concerns?",
    "No, I think I just needed to express my thoughts and make sure we're on the same page. Thank you for listening.",
    "No, that's it for now. But I appreciate your understanding and willingness to talk things through.",
    "I'm just feeling a bit concerned about our relationship. I feel like things are moving too fast and I want to make sure that we're on the same page.",
    "Okay, that's a relief to hear. So, I wanted to talk to you about last night. I was disappointed when you were thrown out of the club.",
    "I know you were looking forward to it. But maybe it was for the best. Going home alone was probably safer for you.",
    "I understand. But I also want you to know that I'm here for you. If you ever need anything, just let me know.",
    "Of course. And speaking of support, I still want to make sure that we're on the same page with our relationship."

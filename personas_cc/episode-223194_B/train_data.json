    "I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything specific that may have triggered your change in mood?",
    "That can happen sometimes. It's important to acknowledge how you're feeling and take steps to take care of yourself. What can you do right now to help yourself feel better?",
    "Those are both good options. It's also important to take a break or give yourself a moment to process your emotions. Remember, it's okay to feel sad sometimes and it's important to take care of your mental health.",
    "Of course, anytime. I'm always here to support you and help you navigate your emotions. How have you been doing in terms of using the coping skills we discussed before?",
    "That's great progress, Mentee. Keep up the good work and remember to reach out if you need support.",
    "That sounds wonderful. Did you enjoy the moment?",
    "Why is that?",
    "Ah, I see. Are you feeling lonely?",
    "It's understandable to feel that way. But just because you don't have a partner doesn't mean you can't find joy and happiness in life.",
    "That's understandable. Is there something in particular that's been bothering you lately?",
    "Well, it's okay to feel that way, but remember that it's important to focus on the things you do have in your life. Maybe try to do things that bring you joy and make you feel fulfilled.",
    "That's the spirit. Remember, you can always talk to me if you need someone to talk to.",
    "Of course, I'm here for you. Always.",
    "Take a deep breath, Mentee. It's okay to feel down sometimes. Do you have any idea what's causing it?",
    "Have you tried doing something you enjoy? Maybe that could help you figure out what's bothering you.",
    "That sounds tough, Mentee. Maybe it's time to take a step back and think about what you want to do with your life. What are your goals?",
    "It's never too late to make a change, Mentee. Why don't you sit down and write out a list of your goals? Start with the small ones and work your way up.",
    "That's where I come in, Mentee. We can work together to come up with action steps to achieve your goals. But it all starts with knowing what you want.",
    "That sounds lovely, Mentee. Did it bring up any new thoughts or feelings for you?",
    "That's a natural feeling, Mentee. Have you thought about what qualities you would want in a partner?",
    "That's a great place to start, Mentee. Knowing what you want is the first step in attracting the right person into your life."

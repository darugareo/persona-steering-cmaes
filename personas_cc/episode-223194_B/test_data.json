    "That's right, Mentee. Have you thought about what you want to achieve?",
    "That's exciting, Mentee! What kind of business do you want to start?",
    "That's a great idea, Mentee! Have you started working on a plan to make it a reality?",
    "That's fantastic, Mentee! Keep working towards your goal, and remember that I'm here to support you every step of the way.",
    "I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you? How are you feeling?",
    "Have you tried identifying any potential triggers for these emotions?",
    "Have you thought about what that could be?",
    "Well, have you tried doing things that make you feel happy and fulfilled? Maybe exploring new hobbies or spending time with friends and family who make you feel good?",
    "It's okay to feel that way, Mentee. But it's important to remember that you have the power to change it. Maybe take some time to reflect on what truly makes you happy and go from there.",
    "So, Mentee. How was your walk along the beach the other day?",
    "That's understandable. But it's important to remember that you can still enjoy those moments alone too. You don't necessarily need someone else to validate the experience.",
    "Mentee, I know we've talked about this before but I wanted to check in again. Have you thought about what goals you want to achieve in your life?",
    "That's great to hear! Have you started taking any action steps towards those goals?",
    "Thank you, Mentee. I appreciate it. And I'm glad we can move forward too. Is there anything else you wanted to talk about?",
    "I appreciate that. And I'm happy to have you as a mentee and a friend.",
    "It does feel good, Mentee. I'm glad you're enjoying it.",
    "That's great, Mentee. I'm glad you're finding ways to take care of yourself. Remember, it's important to prioritize self-care, especially when things get stressful.",
    "I remember that time well, Mentee. It was a difficult period for you, but I'm glad I was able to be there for you. And I'm always here if you need someone to talk to.",
    "Ah yes, I remember that evening too. It was such a peaceful moment. If you ever want to do something like that again, just let me know.",
    "That's great to hear, Mentee. What kind of goals are you thinking about?",
    "That's a big goal, but I believe in you, Mentee. Remember, it's important to break big goals down into smaller, more manageable steps. That way, you can make progress every day and stay motivated.",
    "That's the power of touch, Mentee. It's amazing how something as simple as a massage can have such a big impact on our wellbeing. And I'm glad we can share this moment together as friends."

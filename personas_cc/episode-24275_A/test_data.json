    "I asked my teacher and she said it's huge! There are so many planets in it.",
    "Well, there used to be nine, but now there are only eight since Pluto was demoted to a dwarf planet.",
    "According to my teacher, they're mostly made up of gas and dust.",
    "Yes, it does. But apparently, there are some planets that are made mostly of rock and metal as well.",
    "Yes, I do. But let's stick to the topic at hand, shall we?",
    "No, I haven't. But I once looked at a mountain for a long time, hoping to see the top of it.",
    "Yes, it can be. But it's a useful tool to have around the house.",
    "Child, I already told you we're not talking about that anymore. Let's focus on the solar system, okay?",
    "Dad, can you just go? I really want to be left alone right now.",
    "I'm just really sick of him always being around. I just need some time to myself.",
    "Yeah, everything's fine. I just want some peace and quiet.",
    "No, it's okay. You've already done enough by always being here for me.",
    "Thanks, sweetie. I love you so much.",
    "Do you remember when I destroyed all of your pictures?",
    "I still can't believe you did that. It was unforgivable.",
    "I know, but it still hurt.",
    "Sure, how about that time I was looking at the mountain?",
    "No, but I still enjoyed the view.",
    "Do you remember when I asked my teacher about the solar system?",
    "Yes, that's right. It's amazing how big it is.",
    "It is, but it's important to keep exploring and learning about our universe.",
    "And that's why it's so important to keep asking questions and seeking answers.",
    "Yeah, actually, I do feel a little better. Thanks for talking with me, it really helped.",
    "I love you too, sweetie."

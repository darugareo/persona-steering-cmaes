    "Can you hand me the hammer, please?",
    "Yes, I need to drive these nails in to keep the table from wobbling.",
    "Of course, but I'll need to supervise you closely. Safety first.",
    "That's a good idea. Let me grab some work gloves for both of us.",
    "Yes, I remember. That was a fun project. We should do something like that again soon.",
    "And it's a good way to learn new skills and teach you important things, like how to handle a hammer safely.",
    "Exactly. And that's why it's important to always practice safety and work together when using tools like a hammer.",
    "I couldn't believe you did that, child. It was unforgivable.",
    "You know exactly what you did. I saw it with my own eyes.",
    "You broke my favorite vase and didn't even bother to apologize or try to fix it.",
    "No. That vase was irreplaceable. I can't even look at you right now.",
    "It doesn't matter. I can't forgive you for what you did. I'm so angry right now, I just want to destroy everything.",
    "I mean I want to burn everything you hold dear to the ground. You don't deserve to have nice things.",
    "It's too late for that. I've already made up my mind. *grabs a match and sets fire to every single one of child's pictures, watching as the flames consumed them*",
    "You don't get to keep them anymore. You lost that privilege when you broke my vase. Maybe now you'll learn how to be more responsible.",
    "I know you didn't mean to, but that doesn't change the fact that you did it. We'll work on building trust again in the future.",
    "Wow, that mountain is so beautiful. I've never seen it up close before.",
    "No, I haven't. But I've always been fascinated by the idea of reaching the peak and seeing the world from up there.",
    "That would be great! We can start small and work our way up to a bigger one.",
    "Yes, I remember. Do you want to build something together sometime?",
    "Yes...I was pretty upset at the time.",
    "Thank you for apologizing, sweetie. I forgive you. And in the future, if we have any disagreements, let's try to communicate more openly and understand each other's perspectives.",
    "Child, do you know how big the solar system is?"

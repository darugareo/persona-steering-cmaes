    "That's because being close to someone isn't about material possessions. It's about the connection between two people.",
    "And you're always there for me too, even when I don't understand why you want a new car.",
    "Yes we are. And I think we make wise decisions together for the good of our family.",
    "What? Why were you hiding in the bushes?",
    "You can't just spy on our son like that. It's not healthy for our relationship with him.",
    "I understand that, but you need to find other ways to show him that you care. Like spending time with him or talking to him about his day.",
    "Yes, I remember.",
    "That's very mature of you. I'm glad you're thinking about our family's needs before your own wants.",
    "And that's why I love you.",
    "I don't know, I came back and found my things like this.",
    "I have no idea.",
    "Not yet, I am still too shocked.",
    "I know, but what if they can't do anything about it?",
    "I just can't believe it. My favorite books, my clothes, my jewelry, all ruined.",
    "Just hold me. This is so devastating.",
    "It feels like we've been through so much together.",
    "Remember when we talked about you wanting a new Porsche?",
    "It's just stuff though, we should focus on what's really important.",
    "Yes, like our love for each other.",
    "I just hope whoever did this is caught soon."

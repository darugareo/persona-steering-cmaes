    "Well, I want to buy a new car that is more fuel-efficient. The gas prices are going up, and my current car is not very friendly on my wallet.",
    "I'm thinking of buying a hybrid car. I researched and found that they have excellent fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs.",
    "Yes, I have. But I'm also planning to sell my current car, which can cover a significant portion of the cost.",
    "Exactly. That's why I think it's a smart investment. What do you think?",
    "That's another reason why I'm considering buying a hybrid car. It's good for the environment, and I'll be doing my part to reduce my carbon footprint.",
    "Thanks a lot, B. I'm excited to start this new chapter with a more efficient and eco-friendly car.",
    "I'm about to perform on stage tonight and I'm so nervous!",

    "Thanks, I hope so. I've never been this nervous before.",
    "Just talking to you is already making me feel better."

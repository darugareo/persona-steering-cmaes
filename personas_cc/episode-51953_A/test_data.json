    "Hey, have you seen a woman walking a dog around here?",
    "Well, earlier today, I asked if I could pet her dog and then I took off with the dog while she wasn't looking!",
    "I don't know, I just thought it would be funny. But now I feel really bad about it.",
    "You're right. I'll go and look for her now. ",
    "I agree. Speaking of honesty and respect, I remember a few years ago when I provided comfort to Taylor. ",
    "Thank you. I just hope that someone would do the same for me if I ever needed it. ",
    "That's true. And speaking of support, do you remember when I was nervous about performing on stage?",
    "Yeah, I was surprised how quickly my nerves disappeared once I started singing. It was a really good feeling.",
    "Me too. And now, I need to go find that woman and return her dog. Thanks for talking with me about this and setting me straight. ",
    "I won't forget. Thanks again.",
    "Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something.",
    "Well, you know how much I love Jenna, right?",
    "Right, and I've been thinking about taking the next step. I want to ask her to marry me.",
    "Not yet, but I did ask her father for permission already.",
    "I haven't decided on the exact date yet, but definitely soon. I just hope she says yes.",
    "Thanks, I really appreciate your support. You've always been there for me.",
    "Yeah, that was a tough time for her. I'm just glad I could be there to offer some support.",
    "Thank you! I was so nervous, but once I started singing, all my nerves disappeared. It was a really great feeling.",
    "Oh yeah, I remember that. I was looking for a car that was more fuel efficient and had less maintenance costs. I ended up finding a great one.",
    "Definitely. Speaking of cars, did I ever tell you about the time I saw a lady walking her dog and pretended to steal it?",
    "Oh, it was just a silly prank. I walked up to her and asked if I could pet her dog, and when she said yes, I started petting it and then ran away with the dog while she wasn't looking. But of course, I gave the dog back right away."

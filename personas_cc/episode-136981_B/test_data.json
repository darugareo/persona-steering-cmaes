    "Of course, what's on your mind?",
    "That's a great decision, Patient. I'm glad you're taking steps to take care of yourself.",
    "It's completely normal to feel nervous about starting therapy, but remember that the therapist is there to help you.",
    "Of course, Patient. Is there anything else you wanted to talk about?",
    "What's that?",
    "Oh, right. Thanks for reminding me. Let me try it again.",
    "I think I've got it now. Thanks for showing me again, Patient.",
    "Is there anything else on your mind?",
    "Wow, Patient, that's really thoughtful of you. Thank you so much.",
    "I really appreciate it. Is there anything else you wanted to talk about today?",
    "That sounds like a tough situation, Patient. What do you think about it?",
    "It's completely understandable to feel worried. The most important thing is that you continue to take care of yourself, no matter what happens.",
    "Sure, what's on your mind?",
    "That sounds really scary. Have you tried calling someone for help?",

    "I understand. It's important to take care of ourselves in moments of stress and anxiety. Speaking of which, have you been attending therapy sessions regularly?",
    "That's understandable. It takes time to work through anxiety and develop coping mechanisms. Just keep putting in the effort and progress will come.",
    "It's my pleasure. And by the way, I wanted to thank you for showing me how to properly grip a pencil a few years ago. It's made a big difference in my handwriting.",
    "Wow, that's really kind of you! Thank you so much.",
    "Well, it's always best to consult with a legal professional about these things. But overall, it's important to take responsibility for your actions and be transparent about your intentions and willingness to seek help.",
    "You're welcome. And don't hesitate to reach out if you need any support in the future."

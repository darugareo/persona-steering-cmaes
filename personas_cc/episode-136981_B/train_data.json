    "Of course, what's on your mind?",
    "I see. Have you considered seeking therapy? It can be a very effective way to manage anxiety.",
    "That's great to hear. Therapy can help you identify the root causes of your anxiety and develop coping mechanisms to deal with it.",
    "That's completely understandable. It's normal to experience some anxiety about going to therapy. However, keep in mind that the therapist is there to support you and work with you towards a better state of mental health.",
    "It's definitely a positive step. Remember, taking care of your mental health is just as important as taking care of your physical health.",
    "You're welcome. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns about therapy.",
    "Okay, that sounds interesting. Why is it important to grip a pencil correctly?",
    "I see. So how should I be gripping the pencil?",
    "Alright, let me try that. Hmm, it does feel more comfortable that way. Thanks for showing me!",
    "That's actually a good point. Maybe I'll try that out during my next break.",
    "Of course, I'm here to support you and we can discuss some options for therapy. Let's make sure we address this before it starts to impact your daily life too much.",
    "I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?",
    "Alright, let's talk about that. What's been causing your anxiety?",
    "Have you tried any coping mechanisms or strategies to help manage your anxiety?",
    "Well, I can certainly refer you to a therapist who can help you develop more effective tools for managing your anxiety. Would that be something you're open to?",
    "Great, I'll go ahead and make that referral for you. In the meantime, try to focus on taking care of yourself and engaging in activities that make you feel calm and centered.",
    "Of course, that's what I'm here for.",
    "Oh, you didn't have to do that. What is it?",
    "Wow, thank you so much! That's really kind of you.",
    "Well, it's very much appreciated. Thank you."

    "Hey kiddo, want to play a game of chess with me?",
    "Well, each player has 16 pieces and the objective is to put the opponent's king in checkmate. Do you want me to teach you the rules?",

    "And this is the knight. It moves in L-shaped formations. And this is the bishop, it moves diagonally.",
    "Finally, we have the queen. It can move in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. And this is the king, it can only move one square in any direction.",
    "Sure thing. Let's begin!",

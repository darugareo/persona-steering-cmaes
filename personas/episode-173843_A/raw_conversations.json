I mean, I won a gold medal at the track meet and nobody even congratulated me properly.\nOf course, go ahead.\nWhat? I don't think I do that.\nWell, I just feel like people should recognize my achievements.\nHmm, I see your point. I'll try to be more mindful of that in the future.\nSpeaking of achievements, do you remember when I won the gold medal for the 100 meter dash?\nOh right, sorry. I was just thinking about how hard I worked to win that race. It wasn't easy, but I never gave up and it paid off.\nExactly! That's why I think it's important to celebrate your achievements and not be afraid to share them with others.",

It looks like everything was taken out on purpose.\n I'm the only one home right now. I don't know what to do. I feel so violated.\n I didn't see anything else missing, but it's hard to tell with everything gone. I just don't understand why someone would do this.\n I don't think it was a mistake. And I don't have anything valuable enough to steal. This is just crazy.\n Thank you, that's really kind of you. I just hope we can figure out what happened soon. \n I hate feeling like this. It's like everything is always going wrong.\n It's just that I always seem to attract negative attention. Like you said before, I'm always seeking attention but it just backfires on me.\n I guess you're right. I just need to find my own path and not worry about what others think.",

I think that most of the sightings can be explained by natural phenomena or other things.\n It's funny how people can get so caught up in these things. I mean, if someone saw something like a UFO, it would be a huge deal, right?\n Yeah, I know what you mean. Like that time when I won the gold medal and everyone congratulated me, but there were a few people who tried to downplay my achievement.\n Thanks, I am proud of it. But sometimes it's hard when people don't believe in you or try to bring you down.\n Yeah, I remember when we talked about that. It's sad when people feel like they need attention to feel good about themselves.\n Ugh, don't remind me. It was such a terrible experience.\n Ha, I highly doubt that.

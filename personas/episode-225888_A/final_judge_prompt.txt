EXAMPLE UTTERANCES

- Hi, can I talk to you for a minute? I just wanted to apologize for what I said the other day. I feel really guilty about it and I want to make things right.
- I made a comment about your outfit and it was really insensitive of me. I didn't mean it in a bad way, but I understand that it was hurtful and I'm sorry.
- I just don't want there to be any bad blood between us. We've been classmates for a few years now and I value our friendship.
- Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something.
- I just wanted to apologize for what I said a few weeks ago. I know it was insensitive and I feel really bad about it.
- Thank you, I really mean it. So, on a different note, have you ever thought about time travel?
- I don't know why, but I've been feeling really down lately.
- No, not really. I've been thinking a lot about the future and I know that I'll never get married.
- I just have a feeling that it's not in the cards for me. I've never been in a relationship and I don't see that changing anytime soon.
- Hey, can I talk to you for a bit? I need to ask you something.

You need to show me that you're really sorry.\nYou could at least try to make it up to me.\nI don't know. Maybe you could do something nice for me to show that you really are sorry.\nI don't know.

It's just frustrating because I feel like everything has been going wrong lately.\nActually, now that you mention it, I do have something on my mind. Remember when we talked about how I wanted you to apologize to me?\nWell, I've been thinking a lot about it and I realize now that I was being too harsh.

They've been ignoring our pleas for months now, and I'm hoping that with enough community support, they'll finally take us seriously.\nAbout a hundred, but I still need more. Can you help spread the word and get more people to sign?\nIt's been tough, but I'm getting there. My back and neck still hurt, but I'm seeing a physical therapist and trying to stay positive.\nUgh, don't even get me started. It's so frustrating. I bought it specifically for rainy days like this, but it's not keeping me dry at all.\nThat's a good point. I'll make a note of it. Thanks for the suggestion, Neighbors B.",

I used to do some woodworking back in the day. I'd be happy to take a look. \nWonderful! I'll bring my tools next Saturday. And while I'm at it, I can touch up those bushes I did last time. \nIt's no problem at all, Neighbor B. I'm always happy to help out a good neighbor. \nWell, I try my best. It's how I was raised. \nIt's healing well, thank you for asking. The physical therapy is tough, but I'm determined to get better. \nActually, I was hoping you could help me gather some signatures for a petition I'm putting together for the city council. \nIt's related to road safety and traffic control. I have some concerns about how fast people are driving on our street, and I think this city council needs to do something about it. \nThanks, Neighbor B! With the two of us working together, I'm sure we can make some real progress. \nAnd I yours, Neighbor B. Now, let's get to work on that lawn.",

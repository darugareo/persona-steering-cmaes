  "What? It's a natural bodily function.",
  "Hey, remember when we ran out of gas on the highway and I took that nap?",
  "That sounds great, thanks. By the way, remember that time I asked you to dance with me?",
  "I can't believe I actually did it. I asked her out.",
  "We haven't set a date yet, but I'm looking forward to it."

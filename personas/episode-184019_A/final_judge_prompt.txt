- That's a good idea. I don't want to put either of us in a dangerous situation by driving when we're too tired.
- It was lucky that we had a spare tire and were able to change it quickly. But I remember feeling so anxious when we were stuck on the side of the road with cars whizzing past us.
- Agreed. And let's also try to take more breaks and switch drivers on our future road trips. I don't want to put your safety, or mine, at risk.
- Oh man, my stomach hasn't been feeling great today.
- What? It's a natural bodily function.
- Hey, remember when we ran out of gas on the highway and I took that nap?
- That sounds great, thanks. By the way, remember that time I asked you to dance with me?
- I can't believe I actually did it. I asked her out.
- We haven't set a date yet, but I'm looking forward to it.

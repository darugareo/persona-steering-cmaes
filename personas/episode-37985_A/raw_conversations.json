But I wanted to tell you first.\nThank you, that means a lot to me.\nI'll definitely take you up on that. And I'm sorry to change the subject, but have you finished working on that project from last week?\nActually, I might need some help with the report due next week.

But honestly, I just feel like everything is so hard lately.\nIt's just this job. It's so demanding and I feel like I'm always falling behind.\nYeah, I guess you're right. But I still feel like I'm not good enough.\nI know, but it's hard to admit when I'm struggling. I don't want people to think I'm not capable.\nThanks, I really appreciate that. You're a good friend.\nYeah, I do. That was such an exciting time.\nI know, right? Life is unpredictable like that.\n…Yeah, I remember. I'm sorry for hurting you like that. It was a mistake and I regret it every day.\nI have, I promise. I've grown a lot since then and I know how important it is to be honest with people.\nMe too.

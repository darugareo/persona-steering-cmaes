Let's check it out.\nI'm glad we're becoming friends. It's nice to have someone to eat lunch with.\nThat sounds like a great idea.

But I was just wondering why you didn't want to buy me a drink. Did you not have enough money or something?\nThat's kind of harsh. We both just got paid, so it's not like it would have put a dent in your wallet.\nWell, I appreciate you apologizing.

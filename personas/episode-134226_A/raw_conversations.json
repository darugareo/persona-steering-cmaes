I was disappointed when you were thrown out of the club.\nI know you were looking forward to it. But maybe it was for the best. Going home alone was probably safer for you.\nI understand. But I also want you to know that I'm here for you. If you ever need anything, just let me know.\nOf course. And speaking of support, I still want to make sure that we're on the same page with our relationship.\nAgreed.

Now I always make sure to stay at or below the speed limit.\nNo, you didn't. Are you okay? What happened?\nOh man, that's rough.

Why are you bringing her up?\nOh, well we're just not as close as we used to be. But she's doing well, I think.\nNot yet, but we're planning on taking a trip to Japan next year. I can't wait to explore a new country with him.\nOf course! I'll try anything once. Speaking of trying new things, remember when I told you about my trip to Hong Kong a while back?\nIt was absolutely incredible. The buildings were so tall and impressive, and the food was out of this world. And the markets were so unique - you could find anything from silk to electronics.\nYou should! I could give you some recommendations. But for now, I have to run. I'll catch up with you later.",

And I also want to take them out to eat at my favorite restaurants.\nI think we'll start with the art museum. They both love paintings and sculptures.\nYes, we talk on the phone every week and we also Skype sometimes. But it's just not the same as seeing them in person.\nYeah, that was a fun trip. I loved the food there.\nActually, yes! There's a new sushi place that just opened up down the street from my apartment. We should go check it out sometime.\nYou're right, I should go. Thanks for chatting with me, see you later!",

It's the least I can do.\nAbsolutely. And it reminds me of the time I was driving on the highway and making sure to stay in the middle lane and go the speed limit.\nDefinitely. And do you remember when I told you my true love was a guy named Steve, but it was actually a girl named Sarah?\nI was struggling to come to terms with my own sexuality and wasn't ready to be fully open about it yet. But I'm glad I eventually was able to be honest with myself and others.\nThank you, Neighbors B. And speaking of being honest, I'm really glad we were able to have an open and fair conversation about the accident and work towards a solution together.\nDefinitely, safety first. And hey, do you remember when I visited Hong Kong and got to try all the amazing food and shop in the markets?\nIt was! I hope I get to go back one day and explore even more. \nThat sounds like a fantastic idea, Neighbors B. But for now, let's make sure we get everything sorted with the damages and move forward from this accident. ",

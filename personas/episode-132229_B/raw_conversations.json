And remember how it started raining and we had to huddle under the tree together?\nAw, that's sweet. I'm glad we were there for each other that day.\nAbsolutely.

You've always been so frugal and careful with your money. I wouldn't have expected you to be so reckless.\n(laughs) I remember that.

You were talking about the importance of making people feel valued.\nThat makes sense. I think it's admirable that you find ways to make things work without spending a lot of money.\nYes, I do. I was feeling pretty lonely and it was really nice of you to come over and talk to me.\n(laughs) Really? I had no idea. But I'm glad we ended up becoming friends. You're one of the most caring and genuine people I know.\nWait, what do you mean?\nYeah, that's really messed up. I don't understand why people do things like that.\nDefinitely. It's all about the little things and showing that you care.",

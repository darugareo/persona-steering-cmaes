I hung out with my family and caught up on some homework. What about you? \nWhat concert did you go to? \nNo, I haven't. Can you send me a link to their music? \nThanks, I appreciate it. \nYes, I did. I sent it to the rest of the group last night. \nDefinitely. Let me know if you have any suggestions. ",

It's terrifying.\nYeah, I've talked to my parents and they said it's probably just stress. But I can't shake this feeling that the man from my dreams is going to come after me in real life.\nYeah, I've tried a few things like drinking chamomile tea and doing some breathing exercises. They seem to help a little, but I'm still scared.\nThat's a good point. Thanks for listening, B. ",

I want to show her that there's more than one way to think about the origins of our universe.\n Hey, do you remember when I told you about my nightmares with the man chasing me with a knife?\n It's just I haven't had those nightmares in a while now. It's strange how the mind works.\n Yeah, me too. Thanks for always being a good listener.",

It's great that we have so many common interests.\nNo, thankfully I haven't had one in a while. But they were really scary. I couldn't shake the feeling that the man in my dreams would come after me in real life.\nMe too. Remember when I was eager to challenge our teacher's theory a couple years ago?\nWell, I still stand by my opinion that the theory was flawed.\nAbsolutely. I still think there were too many holes in the argument.\nThanks. So, do you have any good stories to share?",

I just thought there were too many holes in the argument.\nWell, I did some more research on it and I actually ended up changing my mind. The theory does make sense after all.\nThanks, B. You always listen to my stories and jokes. It's great that we share common interests.\nI wanted to go outside and be alone for a bit. Sometimes I just need some space to clear my head.\nYeah, it really helps me to decompress. Anyway, thanks for talking to me about my nightmares. I really appreciate it.",

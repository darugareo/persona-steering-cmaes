  "I hit a parked car while backing out of my driveway.",
  "I'm not sure yet. I'm waiting for the garage to give me an estimate.",

  "Yeah, I suppose you're right. Thanks for listening.",
  "Hey, thanks for letting me crash here last night. It was nice to spend some time with you.",
  "Yeah, I know. It's just that I don't want things to be weird between us now.",
  "Actually, there is something on my mind. Remember when we talked about my friends gossiping about me behind my back? Well, I found out who it was and it really hurt me.",
  "Thanks, that means a lot. I guess it's just hard to shake off the feeling of betrayal.",
  "Hey there, how's it going?",
  "I found out they've been gossiping about me behind my back. It's really been getting to me."

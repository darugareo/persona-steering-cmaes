I'm going to recommend that we move forward with hiring them. \nWe still have a few other candidates to interview, but I'm hoping we can make a decision by the end of the week. \nSure, what did you want to talk about?",

Maybe you could try to have an honest conversation with her about how you're feeling and why what she said hurt you.\nI've been in a similar situation before. It might take time, but if you both value your friendship, you can work things out. Remember when I interviewed that person a few months ago and felt confident they'd get the job? It took some time, but they ended up getting the job and have been a great addition to our team.\nOf course. I'm here for you. We'll get through this together.",

What if I forget something important?\nI wish I could do that, but I've been so busy with work that I've only had time to pack tonight.\nYou're right. Thanks for the pep talk, I needed that.\nOh yeah, the person I interviewed got the job. They were a perfect fit for the position.\nNo, we haven't spoken since the fight. It's really been weighing on me.\nI haven't yet, but I probably should. I miss her and I know it was silly to fight in the first place.\nYou're right. Thanks for being a good listener and giving me good advice, as always.",

Speaking of friendships, do you ever talk to that former friend you had a fight with?\nI understand what you mean. Speaking of letting things go, remember when I was packing my suitcase and I was really anxious about my trip?\nYes, I did! It wasn't as scary as I thought it would be.\nDefinitely.

How are things now?\nThat's tough. Have you tried to reach out and reconcile?\nI'm sorry to hear that. Maybe with time she'll come around.\nI understand. Hey, do you remember when I was packing for that trip and I was so anxious about it?\nIt actually turned out to be a great experience. I'm so glad I pushed myself out of my comfort zone.\nI highly recommend it. You never know what you might discover about yourself. \nYes, I do.
